# Week 13 Sprint (4/30 - 5/7)

This week is a big week for me as far as interviews and getting aligned with a job. Hopefully Lisa's tax return comes and gives us a solid break from worrying about money for a little bit, at least until I have a pacycheck coming in.

## Backlog

- [ ] Getting content/blog posts out - need to focus better when writing
- [ ] Finishing websites completely - could have had [[GeauxWeisbeck4.dev]] done way sooner
- [ ] Logseq - Need to get that all organized and ready to pump content and notes somewhere as a CMS before I'm too slowed down with the disorganized file system I set up

## To Do This Week

- [ ] Rental Application
- [ ] Deploy [GeauxWeisbeck4.dev](https://geauxweibeck4.dev)
- [ ] Hashnode Blog Post #1 - 5
- [ ] Newsletter Course Bash
- [ ] Donation place
- [ ] Garage Sale Store/Marketplace
- [ ] AI CV generator & job application bot
- [ ] Algorithms and Data Structures
- [ ] Lisa's Website

# Done

Nothing as of yet. Yeeek...

## Reflections

Damn.

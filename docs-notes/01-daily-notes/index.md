# Daily Notes 

Welcome to my collection of daily notes, imported from [Logseq]
(https://logseq.com) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.com). These daily notes 
are meant to 1. give me some accountability for those who are involved in my 
life and 2. for your entertainment. 

Each day I have a little free write section/summary, a to do list, resources,
readings, and links, a pomodoro planner, and other various fun note things.

I hope you enjoy!

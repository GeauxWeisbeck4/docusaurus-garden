# Notes

Welcome to my collection of organized notes. While I have a decent collection of my notes on this site, it is tiny compared to what I have in my Digital Garden, which is dwarfed by what I have in Logseq and Obsidian. I am a note taking freak.

These are for learning purposes and you can totally steal them and do whatever you like with them. Please - I'm an open source of information and I want you to take all of it from my brain and use it for your own good. I'm a teacher by heart so it warms my own heart to see you learning to your hearts content.

Anyways, lets get on with the notes!

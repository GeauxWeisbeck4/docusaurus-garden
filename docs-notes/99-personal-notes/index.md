# 02 - Personal Notes

One thing you'll find with me is that I am a very up front 
and am somewhat of an open book about my life. With that being said, there 
will be some things that you'll find in these notes that may upset you or 
bring up certain emotions that are uncomfortable - just know that whatever 
you're feeling is normal. My intention is not to make you feel a certain 
type of way, but it is rather to put my experiences out there so that 
somebody who is going through something that I have can relate and feel 
comfortable asking for help like I did. 

Some of the stuff is happy, but some of it is pretty dark and tough to go 
through. Feel free to [reach out to me if you need to tall](/contact) or you 
can speak with a licensed professional in your area. I am working on a 
directory app to list mental health professionals, so that will be a 
resource I will make available. 

Onto the personal stuff.

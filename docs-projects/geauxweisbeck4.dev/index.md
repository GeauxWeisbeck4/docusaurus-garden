# GeauxWeisbeck4.dev

GeauxWeisbeck4.dev is sort of the most important project out of everything 
I've ever built or created since it is basically my online resume. This 
website you are currently on is already version number 3. I'll talk more 
about all three of the versions and their histories on each of their own 
seperate docs page.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to have a main website where I can host all 
my knowledge and the projects I've created. I also use it as a place where 
people can find my contact info, links to other projects, my social media 
accounts, and blog posts and idea.s

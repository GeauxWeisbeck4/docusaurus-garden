# GeauxWeisbeck4.agency

GeauxWeisbeck4 has been my personal brand, but it wasn't until recently that 
I used it as my freelancing brand agency. That was reserved to Tar Heel Dev 
Studio, my original web dev agency. I made this decision because it felt 
more practical and that the brand would better represent myself and my 
values more so that trying to come up with some for a brand that didn't 
necessarily say alot about who I am.

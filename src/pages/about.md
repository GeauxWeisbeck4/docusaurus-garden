# About Andrew

I'm Andrew Weisbeck, a 31 year old full-stack web developer, specializing in full-stack JavaScript & Python app development topped with a layer of Jamstack flavoring. I am a creative-minded problem solver with a passion for learning new things and teaching others. My diverse career path includes a decade of experience marketing digital products, designing solutions for everyday problems, and innovating new ways to improve user experience.

User experience, customer service, patient relationship management - whatever you want to call the direct experience of whoever it is you serve in your position, is the most important metric in any kind of career you choose. The best advice I can give to anyone preparing for their future is to get a job in customer service and master building great relationships with your clients. It doesn't matter if you are 38 and have a headset on in the McDonald's drive through, each customer that drives through your drive through during your shift is the most important customer you will ever have - treat them like it. I promise that attitude will bring you success.

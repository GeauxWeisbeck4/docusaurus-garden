# Introduction to 11ty Tutorial

One of the most influential SSGs in my development career had one of the most influential tutorial sites ever on its documentation site - [Learn 11ty From Scratch](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com). I don't know if there will be another tutorial website like this one... *sniff*...

Well, since that sites been deprecated, it is time for somebody new to step up and create their own 11ty from scratch tutorial and I think I'm just the guy for this job! How about I start with my own little 11ty tutorial here, and if it is good enough I will make my own learn11tyfromscratch.com website!

## Requirements for following along

- Node.js >= 16.0 (just a guess on the version)
- Terminal (Widows use Hyper... or something)
- An IDE like Visual Studio Code or JetBrains WebStorm
- A positive attitude!

## About 11ty

You might be wondering - what the hell makes 11ty so great? Well what if I told you its because I like it and that I invented it before the creator of 11ty did - I just called it 10er. It was actually much faster back then...

Yeah right - I couldn't come up with something as rad as 11ty like [Zach Leatherman](https://zachleatherman.com) did. You may want to watch out for my static site generator I'm working on for Deno however, as I believe it will take the Jamstack world by storm. Back to 11ty, here are some of the features that are beloved by its dedicated community of 11ters:

- Data Cascading
- Templating with any templating language
- Outstanding dev community with lots of resources

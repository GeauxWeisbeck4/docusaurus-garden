# Dev Journal Day One - April 27, 2023

**I'm going to be documenting my developer journey on my digital garden whenever I get finished/mostly done with that website so I can see and share my latest progress. I think I haven't done the best at really looking and reflecting on where I was and where I am now, because it is pretty significant and should be something I am proud of and something I believe others would find impressive. So here we go, getting started with Day One of my Dev Journal!**

Today was a "productive day" as I built this portfolio site, starting at 4 PM EST and the time is now 7:48 PM EST - I think I will be satisfied with it enough to share with the world in about 45 minutes as long as I get my notes, docs, and tutorials laid out correctly. I spent most of the day trying to get unstuck from a hectic past 3 months of being homeless.

There are so many new open source projects, cool articles, tutorials, etc. that are easy to get caught up in - imagine not really being on point for 3 months when you only have time for a couple lines of code each day before you have to practice defending your life partner from a pack of ravenous crack heads trying to steal your trapper keeper full of tax return papers.

## What I learned today

I always love the what I learned today blogs, so I get to implement my own now! Here is what I learned:

- How to use 3JS for real - see resource
- How to use Redis in Upstash
- How to build a Pomodoro Timer and To Do List with Svelte
- How to code using Rust Lang
- Building a Hugo site

## What I built today

Well, this list can be huge, or small, depending on what I count for "built". I think maybe any project I had at least one commit on that day? Fair enough:

- [GeauxWeisbeck4.dev](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev) using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)
  - I implemented the blog and started on the docs, tutorials, and notes pages.
  - Did the about page
  - Started on the Home page
  - Will deploy at end of day

- [Geaux Pomodoro Timer and Journal](https://geauxpomodoro.netlify.app) using Svelte
  - Will deploy once I figure out how to configure on Netli

## Code Snippet for the Day


## Summary

I will say that today was a huge growth day for me. I found it super easy to debug this new site I made, which has come from many frustrating hours of debugging. Rust is making sense now and I feel ready to build an app with it soon. Completed the first day of my 50 days of projects deal - I want to be 5 days ahead before I launch, so keep focused on the goal and the dream.

On the work front, JS Chimp reached out with a project and I had a few recruiters chomping at the bit. It feels good to be finding work again.

Until tomorrow!

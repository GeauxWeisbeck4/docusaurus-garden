# Understanding Homelessness Can Only Happen By Being Homeless

Waking up in a tent again wasn't the greatest for my back, but the fresh air was wonderful for my mind. Being homeless makes being a web developer difficult for its own reasons, but I have found a renewed sense of awe in technology and I feel my creativity has been somewhat revitalized in these last three months living without a home.

No, the poverty and lack of basic necessities has not been great for me. I've missed out on jobs simply because I didn't have access to internet. But the lack of walls that feel like suffocating barriers (as in the case of my last apartment), has given me a new independence that I have grown to appreciate - one that doesn't need technology every second of every day to feel like I'm not bored. No structure to my day has made the days fly by.

These benefits obviously can't be sustained because I need to begin working again ASAP and get back to my life, but it has felt like somewhat of a get away mentally that I think I needed in order to appreciate my life. I don't say vacation, because you don't have people scowling at you, telling you to leave their business on vacation. You don't have men honking their horns at your fiance, trying to pick her up for a car date because they think she will because she's homeless.

No, it has been far from a vacation. Often times it has been an absolute hell. I don't want to give the wrong idea that being homeless has been pleasurable - it has been mostly the direct opposite. But what I mean is that there have been fleeting moments of freedom, grit, and deep love for my partner whom I have suffered through the bottom of the barrel with. These deep emotions could not be experienced in a regular day of someone who has their most basic needs for survival - these arise from moments of despair, hunger, and desperation that I hope you don't have to face.

But these moments truly touch on the very depth of what it is to be human - to suffer and to be completely broken. The main objective though is to rebuild from this shattering of ego - to become a better person for seeing the world through a broken lense.

To understand what all the poor souls who wander around hungry and lost feel like. To understand what it is like to sleep on the cold hard ground, lonely and homesick for your lost friends and family. To understand what it is like to stink horribly like you haven't showered in days, and to be removed from a public place for that very reason.

Going through this has given me a truly beautiful gift that not a lot of people get to receive and recover from - the gift of true empathy, empathy for the weak and broken that nobody can understand until they have walked in those shoes. The pain and darkness, the humility and shame of being looked at like a pitiful existence of skin, water, and bones.

I now understand what the lost man sees when the rich man walks by without even glancing his way to see what his sign says. And the signs asking for money - oh how true they are! Maybe the message could be false - no, I don't need the money for a sandwich, but rather for drugs and booze. But often times the person flying the sign would rather have food and shelter more than anything.

We have it all wrong - they aren't homeless and on the street for the drugs, no. The drugs help you cope with your existence really. It's mental health, failure of government and the systems, its a failure of humanity - especially a failure of the richest nation on earth, letting people sleep in boxes and go hungry at night.

Homelessness is not a choice of the person living in it - it is a collection of choices by those who have homes, imposing homelessness on those whom they deem unfit for housed society.

Until we decide that we actually want to help other people who are struggling, the blame lies with those who will just stand by and watch as people continue to fall like flies on the street.

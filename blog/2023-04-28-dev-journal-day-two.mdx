# Day Two - Friday

I got quite a bit done today - it felt like the most productive day in quite
some time. It was more of a learning day/work on this website. Well, this
was the main thing coding wise - but it involved things like my Javascript
notes, styling with CSS, and looking through old notes and GitHub
repositories to figure out what should go on here.

Docusaurus is both wonderful and also a pain in the ass. I spent like half
the day trying to get my sidebar to render how I wanted it to. I think I had
it half right the first time I tried to render the notes, projects, and
tutorial docs on the left sidebar. But then I spent like 5 hours trying to
figure it out and reading articles.

Anyways, this site was still pretty fun to make despite the day long trouble
with the sidebar - makes me feel stupid. I'm going to try and make these posts
less rambling-like somehow, but I haven't decided how yet. I just haven't
had a lot of exciting things to talk about at the moment as I get my dev
life caught back up to wherever it was before March & April.

I'll leave that as a jumping-off point for the weekend - see y'all next week!
